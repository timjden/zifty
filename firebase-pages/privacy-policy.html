    <h1>Privacy Policy for Zifty</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 9th September 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Zifty does not collect any personal information such as your name, email
      address, or other identifiable details. The only data we store is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscription Status:</strong> Whether you are a free or paid
        subscriber, including subscription dates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User Preferences:</strong> Settings within the extension, such
        as which toggles or features you have enabled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you choose not to sign in with Google, we do not store any user data at
      all.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Tracking of User Activity</h2>
    <p>
      Zifty does not gather user activity or behavior. We do not store search
      queries. All search queries processed through Zifty are handled
      client-side, and no search data is sent or stored on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      The data we collect is used solely to provide and improve the
      functionality of the Zifty extension:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Subscription Status:</strong> To ensure that you have access to
        the appropriate features based on your subscription.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>User Preferences:</strong> To remember and apply your preferred
        settings within the extension.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Zifty does not sell, trade, or transfer any of your data to third parties.
      Your information is used exclusively for the operation of the Zifty
      extension.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect the data we collect against
      unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no
      internet-based service can be fully secure, so we cannot guarantee
      absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
      significant changes, we will notify you through the extension or other
      appropriate means. The date of the latest revision will be indicated at
      the top of this document.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
